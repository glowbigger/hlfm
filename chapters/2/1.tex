\section{The formal system \texorpdfstring{\(L\)}{L}}

A \textit{formal system} is a mathematical structure representing a deductive system. It consists of
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A set of symbols.

  \item A set of finite strings of these symbols representing the valid sentences in the system. Each string is called a \textit{well-formed formula}, or \textit{wf} for short.

    There is usually a formula, called a \textit{grammar}, for determining which strings are wfs.

  \item A subset of the set of wfs representing the axioms.

  \item A finite set of \textit{inference rules}, functions which take a set of wfs and return a wf. The returned wf is said to be deduced from the set of wfs.
\end{enumerate}
